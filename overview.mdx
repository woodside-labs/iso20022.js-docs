## Introduction

`iso20022.js` and `fiatwebservices` were built to be used together to build software that sends payments.

This library was built to help companies communicate with banks using ISO20022 standards to move money or ingest financial data. Some examples of how companies may use `iso20022.js` include:

### Payment Initiation (PAIN)

Create payment initiation messages to [instruct your bank to send money on your behalf](/pain/swiftcredit).

Currently we support money movement for the following payment types:

- **[ACH](/pain/achcredit)**
- **[SEPA](/pain/sepacredit)**
- **[SWIFT](/pain/swiftcredit)**
- **[U.S. Real Time Payment](/pain/rtpcredit)**

If you're looking for a payment rail that's currently in development, please email us at [iso20022js@woodside.sh](mailto:iso20022js@woodside.sh). Rails that are currently in development include:

- **[U.S. Fedwire](mailto:iso20022js@woodside.sh)**
- **[Australian BECS](mailto:iso20022js@woodside.sh)**
- **[Canadian EFT](mailto:iso20022js@woodside.sh)**
- **[Chinese CNAPS](mailto:iso20022js@woodside.sh)**

### Cash Management (CAMT)

Ingest Cash Management XML files to [retrieve current day balances and transactional information](/camt/camt) from your bank.

The mission of this library is to connect the most widely used programming language to the most widely used payment standard. If there's a usecase that you're looking for, please email us at [iso20022js@woodside.sh](mailto:iso20022js@woodside.sh).

## Primer on ISO20022

ISO20022 is a set of modern file-based messaging standards that allow a company to programatically communicate with their bank. You can use it to send payment or ingest financial data. Within the ISO20022 standard are a few namespaces that enables different sets of capabilities.

| Namespace | Capability |
|-----------|------------|
| Payment Initiation (pain)      | Used to initiate a payment from a company to a bank |
| Cash Management (camt)      | Used to send or receive transactional information and balances from a bank |
| Payments Clearing and Settlement (pacs)      | Used to settle payments between banks |

There are many more namespaces of ISO20022, but this is what's currently supported by the library, which enables companies to talk with banks to move money.
