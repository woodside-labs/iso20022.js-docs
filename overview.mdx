## Introduction

This library was built to help companies communicate with banks using ISO20022 standards to move money or ingest financial data. Some examples of how companies may use `iso20022.js` include:

### Payment Initiation (PAIN)

Create payment initiation XML files to [instruct your bank to send money on your behalf](/pain/swiftcredit).

### Cash Management (CAMT)

Ingest Cash Management XML files to [retrieve current day balances and transactional information](/camt/camt) from your bank.

The mission of this library is to connect the most widely used programming language to the most widely used payment standard. If there's a usecase that you're looking for, please email us at [svapnil@woodside.sh](mailto:svapnil@woodside.sh).

## Primer on ISO20022

ISO20022 is a set of modern file-based messaging standards that allow a company to programatically communicate with their bank. You can use it to send payment or ingest financial data. Within the ISO20022 standard are a few namespaces that enables different sets of capabilities.

| Namespace | Capability |
|-----------|------------|
| Payment Initiation (pain)      | Used to initiate a payment from a company to a bank |
| Cash Management (camt)      | Used to send or receive transactional information and balances from a bank |
| Payments Clearing and Settlement (pacs)      | Used to settle payments between banks |

There are many more namespaces of ISO20022, but this is what's currently supported by the library, which enables companies to talk with banks to move money.
