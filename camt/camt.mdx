# Cash Management End of Day Report (CAMT.053)

The `CashManagementEndOfDayReport` class represents a Cash Management End of Day Report (CAMT.053.x). This class encapsulates the data and functionality related to processing and accessing information from a CAMT.053 XML file.

Unlike Payment Initation messages, you do not need an `iso20022` object to create them with, since all the relevant data is contained within the XML.

## Usage

To create a `CashManagementEndOfDayReport` instance from a raw XML string:


```typescript
import { CashManagementEndOfDayReport } from 'iso20022.js';
const rawXml = '...'; // Your CAMT.053 XML string
const report = CashManagementEndOfDayReport.fromXML(rawXml);
```

## Types

For detailed information about the types used in this class (such as `Statement`, `Entry`, `Transaction`, and `Party`), please refer to the API documentation.


## Properties

- `messageId`: Gets the unique identifier for the message.
- `recipient`: Gets the party receiving the report.
- `creationDate`: Gets the date and time when the report was created.
- `statements`: Gets all statements included in the report.
- `transactions`: Retrieves all transactions from all statements in the report.
- `entries`: Retrieves all entries from all statements in the report.

## Methods

### `static fromXML(rawXml: string): CashManagementEndOfDayReport`

Creates a `CashManagementEndOfDayReport` instance from a raw XML string.

- `rawXml`: The raw XML string containing the CAMT.053 data.
- Returns: A new instance of `CashManagementEndOfDayReport`.
- Throws: An error if the XML parsing fails or required data is missing.

```typescript
const report = CashManagementEndOfDayReport.fromXML(rawXml);
console.log(report.messageId);
console.log(report.recipient);
console.log(report.creationDate);
```

```typescript
const report = CashManagementEndOfDayReport.fromXML(rawXml);
report.statements.forEach(statement => {
    console.log(statement.accountId);
    console.log(statement.balances);
});
```
