# ACHCreditPaymentInitiation

<Info>If you want to learn more about ACH (Automated Clearing House), please refer to the <a href="https://www.nacha.org/">Official NACHA website</a>.</Info>

The `ACHCreditPaymentInitiation` class is used to generate ACH Credit Payment Initiation messages. These are primarily used for electronic funds transfers within the United States banking system.

It can be created via the `ACHCreditPaymentInitiationConfig` interface.

## Constructor

```typescript
// Example Usage
const config: ACHCreditPaymentInitiationConfig = {
    initiatingParty: {
        name: 'John Doe Corporation',
        id: 'JOHNDOE99',
        account: {
            accountNumber: '0123456789'
        },
        agent: {
            abaRoutingNumber: '123456789'
        }
    },
    paymentInstructions: [
        {
            type: 'ach',
            direction: 'credit',
            amount: 100000, // $1000.00
            currency: 'USD',
            creditor: {
                name: 'John Doe Funding LLC',
                account: {
                    accountNumber: '0123456789'
                },
                agent: {
                    abaRoutingNumber: '0123456789'
                }
            },
            remittanceInformation: 'Invoice #12345',
        }
    ],
    localInstrument: 'CCD' // Optional, defaults to CCD (Corporate Credit or Debit)
}

const ach = new ACHCreditPaymentInitiation(config)
```

Initializes a new `ACHCreditPaymentInitiation` instance with the provided configuration.

## Methods

### serialize(): string

```typescript
const xmlString = ach.serialize();
console.log(xmlString);
```

Serializes the `ACHCreditPaymentInitiation` instance into an XML string representation. The resulting XML string can be used to send the payment to the bank.

### toString(): string

Alias for `serialize()`.

### static fromXML(rawXml: string): ACHCreditPaymentInitiation

```typescript
const achPayment = ACHCreditPaymentInitiation.fromXML(xmlString);
```

Creates a new `ACHCreditPaymentInitiation` instance from an XML string.

## Validation

The class includes built-in validation to ensure the payment initiation data meets the required standards:

- Message ID must not exceed 35 characters.
- All payment instructions must have USD as the currency.
- Amount values should be specified in cents (e.g., 100000 for $1000.00).
- ABA routing numbers must be valid and properly formatted.
- Account numbers must be valid for US banking.
